# IPL Match Prediction Pipeline

This repository contains a complete data science project for predicting IPL match outcomes using ball-by-ball data. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction with PCA, and model training with XGBoost. Additionally, the code provides comprehensive visualizations for performance metrics and correlation analyses.

## Overview

The project leverages ball-by-ball IPL match data to generate match-level features, such as team form, historical win rates, head-to-head stats, and venue-specific performance metrics. Using these features, the pipeline:
- Standardizes numerical data,
- Applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality,
- Trains a binary classification model using XGBoost to predict match winners,
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve,
- Visualizes both model performance and feature correlations.

This approach helps in understanding the key factors influencing match outcomes and provides actionable insights for sports analytics.

## Features

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Loads IPL ball-by-ball data and converts it to match-level statistics.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creates custom features such as team form (based on recent matches), win rates, and head-to-head records.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Uses PCA to transform and reduce numerical feature space while preserving variance.
- **Modeling:** Implements an XGBoost classifier for match outcome prediction.
- **Visualization:** Provides plots for PCA explained variance, performance metrics, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and correlation matrices.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Kshitij-0710/The-IPL-Prediction/tree/main
   cd ipl-match-prediction
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```


## Usage

1. **Prepare your data:**
   - Place the `ipl.csv` dataset in the repository’s root directory or update the file path in the code accordingly.

2. **Run the pipeline:**
   ```bash
   python your_script.py
   ```
   This script will execute the following steps:
   - Load and preprocess the IPL data.
   - Engineer match-level features.
   - Standardize numerical features and perform PCA.
   - Train an XGBoost model.
   - Generate performance and correlation visualizations.

3. **Output:**
   - Several images (e.g., `pca_variance.png`, `confusion_matrix.png`, `roc_curve.png`, etc.) will be saved in the repository, showcasing the analysis and performance of the model.
